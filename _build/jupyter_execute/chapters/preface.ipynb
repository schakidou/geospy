    "[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) (GEE) is a cloud computing platform with a [multi-petabyte catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. During the past few years, GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community and it has empowered numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers. Compared with the comprehensive [documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) and interactive IDE (i.e., [GEE JavaScript Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com)) of the GEE JavaScript API, the GEE Python API has relatively little documentation and limited functionality for visualizing results interactively. The **geemap** Python package was created to fill this gap. It is built upon a number of open-source Python libraries, such as the [earthengine-api](https://pypi.org/project/earthengine-api), [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), [ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet), and [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets). Geemap enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter environment with minimal coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book takes a hands-on approach to help you get started with the GEE Python API and geemap. You'll start with the fundamentals of geemap by creating and customizing interactive maps. You'll then learn how to load cloud-based Earth Engine datasets and local geospatial datasets onto the interactive maps. As you advance through the chapters, you'll walk through practical examples of using geemap to visualize and analyze Earth Engine datasets, and will learn about exporting data from Earth Engine. You will also learn about more advanced topics such as building and deploying interactive web apps with Earth Engine and geemap.\n",

    "\n",
    "Το βιβλίο απευθύνεται σε φοιτήτριες/ές, τόσο προπτυχιακού όσο και μεταπτυχιακού επιπέδου, οι οποίοι ασχολούνται με τα χωρικά δεδομένα και την ανάλυσή τους πέρα από το τυπικό περιβάλλον ενός desktop G.I.S λογισμικού. Το βιβλίο δεν είναι εξαντλητικό αλλά προσπαθεί να παρουσιάσει κάποιες βασικές βιβλιοθήκες της Python καθώς και τον τρόπο με τον οποίον μπορούμε να δημιουργήσουμε ένα περιβάλλον εργασίας και ανάλυσης των δεδομένων. Βασικές Έννοιες εξηγούνται μέσω παραδειγμάτων. Το πλεονέκτημα του Βιβλίου είναι ο δυναμικός του χαρακτήρας, που επιτρέπει τη διαρκή ενημέρωσή του.\n",

    "## To get the most out of this book\n",
    "\n",
    "This book assumes that you are at least a Python novice, which means that you are comfortable with the basic Python syntax, such as variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions. If you know how to make lists and define variables and have written a `for` loop before, you have enough Python knowledge to get started! To get the most out of this book, we highly encourage you to type the code yourself in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab). This will help you understand the code and help you understand the book. You can also download the code examples from the book's GitHub repository at <https://github.com/giswqs/geebook>. Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.\n",
